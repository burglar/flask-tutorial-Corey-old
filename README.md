# Flask tutorial

## Intro

Using this repo to follow the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH) made by Corey Schafer. 

## Git

I'll use this repo to better understand git also.\
I'm gona make more changes so I can rebase several commits in source tree.\
For now I think I have 3 or 4 commits before pushing to origin. I'll squash this commits together and push just one commit.
